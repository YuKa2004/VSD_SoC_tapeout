# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program – My VSD Journey 

Welcome to my personal documentation of the **VLSI System Design (VSD) RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**!  
This repository tracks my progress week-by-week as I go from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools, as part of India’s largest collaborative silicon design initiative.

## 📅 Week 0 – Setup & Tool Installation

| Task     | Description                                  | Status |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|--------|
| Task 0   | 🛠️ Installed Icarus Verilog, Yosys, and GTKWave | ✅ Done |

### 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0
- Successfully installed and configured key open-source EDA tools.
- Understood the RTL design environment and basic synthesis flow setup.
- System is now ready for full digital design journey — from RTL to GDSII.
